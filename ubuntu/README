These are the files I use for working on my PPA packages.

Also, I will add some tips here.


## Adding a PPA to pbuilder-dist
Took from http://askubuntu.com/questions/265703/how-to-do-a-pbuilder-dist-build-with-dependencies-in-a-ppa
1. Add to your *.pbuilderrc* the **OTHERMIRROR** variable like
```
OTHERMIRROR="deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/itachi-san/gvfs-mtp/ubuntu precise main|deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/itachi-san/ffmpeg/ubuntu precise main"
```
2. Add GPG keys to your pbuilder-dist instance
```
pbuilder-dist precise login --save-after-login
apt-key adv --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 2FADEBF5 18F5A5F7
exit
```
3. Update sources in your pbuilder-dist instances
```
pbuilder-dist precise update --release-only
```
4. Build with ease
```
pbuilder-dist precise build PACKAGE.dsc
```
